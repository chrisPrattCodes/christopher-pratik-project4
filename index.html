<!-- Customer enters their required search parameters (ingredients, course type, cusisine type, dietary restrictions) -->
	<!-- Example of a search for chicken and broccoli / Main dish / Italian / No dietary restriction -->
		<!-- Do an API call for all recipes with chicken and broccoli -->
		<!-- Then filter the results based on the other criteria - starting with course type - then cuisine type - then dietary restrcitions -->
<!-- The data is pulled from the API and displayed onto the page in a list -->
	<!-- The filtered results will then be broken down into individual recipes - displaying an image of the dish, the name of the dish and a description of it -->
<!-- The recipes will be clickable to take them to a full view of them -->
	<!-- The recipes will be opened in a new tab -->
